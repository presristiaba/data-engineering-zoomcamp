MODO BASS 2 adds 8 new basses to the original 12 models, including new fretless and upright options. You can choose from classic vintage models like the Fender Jazz Bass or the Rickenbacker 4003, to modern metal beasts like the Dingwall NG2 or the Warwick Streamer. You can also customize every aspect of your bass sound, from the string type and gauge, to the pickup position and tone control, to the effects chain and amp simulation.
 
But MODO BASS 2 is not only about sound, it's also about performance. You can control how your bass is played with advanced features like slides, mutes, harmonics, ghost notes and more. You can also use the new patterns section to add some groove to your bass lines with tons of new MIDI grooves in different genres and styles. You can even create your own patterns with the built-in sequencer and export them as MIDI files.
 
MODO BASS 2 is compatible with any DAW that supports VST, AU or AAX plugins. You can also use it standalone with your MIDI controller or keyboard. Whether you are a producer, a composer, a songwriter or a bassist, MODO BASS 2 can help you achieve the perfect bass sound for your music.
